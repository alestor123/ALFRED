# Alfred Bot Updates

Here's what's new and improved in your Alfred Bot!

## ✨ New Features & Major Improvements

<b>🌐 Enhanced Language Support & Automatic Translation:</b>
- You can now select your preferred language (English, Malayalam, or Hindi) in Settings!
- All bot messages will be automatically translated to your chosen language.

<b>💪 Revamped Motivation Feature:</b>
- Enjoy unlimited daily motivation!
- Get inspiring Zen quotes directly, replacing the previous YouTube Shorts feature.

<b>⏰ Task Reminders (Ongoing Improvements):</b>
- Task `dueDate` calculation is now more robust, ensuring reminders can be set correctly.
- Reminders are now set to trigger 5 minutes before the task's start time (as per your latest request).
- Mute/unmute settings are respected for these reminders.
- The way reminders are initialized for new tasks has been fixed to ensure they are active.

## 🛠️ Fixes & Stability Enhancements

<b>🚀 Improved Stability:</b>
- Resolved crashes related to sending empty messages, especially after translation.
- Guidance provided to address "409 Conflict" errors (caused by multiple bot instances running) for smoother operation. Please ensure you are running only one instance, especially by stopping `nodemon` and running `node cli.js` for testing, or by implementing graceful shutdown.
- Fixed an issue where menu text was not always being translated.

<b>✅ Task System:</b>
- Enhanced error checking during task creation and reminder processing.

<b>🧹 Menu Updates:</b>
- The "Availability" and "Reminders" features were temporarily hidden from the main menu previously (you can uncomment them if needed).
